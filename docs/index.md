# Welcome to the SAXS tutorials

For information about the Structural Biology Platform, visit our [website](https://biochimie.umontreal.ca/en/scientific-platforms-bmm/structural-biology/).

To reserve time on the BioSAXS, fill up this [form](https://biochimie.umontreal.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2018/10/SAXS_time_request.pdf) and send it to the Structural Biology Platform manager, Normand Cyr, by [email](mailto:normand.cyr@umontreal.ca).


## What is SAXS?

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a technique used to derive low resolution structural information about the shape, size, electronic density, molecular weight and conformational changes of macromolecules in solution by taking advantage of the scattering intensities at different angles.
